#X text 477 570 [smsedit] is part of a library for using Spectral Model
Synthesis techniques in pd. For more information and to see how the
analysis/synthesis externals work together \, see the main help file

#X text 74 115 <-- once data is loaded into smsbuf \, you need to send
a buffer command in order to initialize the synthesizer based on the
model's parameters. If [smsedit] does not have the buffer name as it's
first argument \, you will need to provide it as an argument with the
"buffer" message;
#X msg 102 242 bp add freq 10 5 20;
#X text 232 242 <-- change an individual breakpoint within the model.
This will edit one partial at one particular point in time. It needs
the following arguments: 1 operation (set \, add \, scale) 2 component
(freq \, amp) 3 frame # 4 track # 5 value to edit the data (will be
set \, added \, or scaled by this factor);
#X text 503 68 [smsedit] is an external for editing the data stored
within an [smsbuf]. It will change the model \, permenantly \, so it
might be a good idea to make a backup of the model using [smsnbuf]'s
"backup" message (stores a duplicate) before editing. You can then
use the "switch" message to [smsbuf] or the converge message to [smsedit]
to get the data back to normal.;
#X msg 96 466 converge 10 0.1;
#X text 202 469 <-- if your [smsbuf] has a backup of the data \, you
can slowly average between the two until you have the original again.
arguments: 1 frame # 2 weight of original (0-1.0);

#X text 167 552 <-- more information printed;
#X text 502 161 There could be many more useful methods to [smsedit]
\, which can be coded in the c file or you can make higher level abstractions
for editing many partials/frames with one command.;
#X msg 93 361 everyother transpose 10 3 2;
#X text 299 358 <-- change all the even partials of a specified frame.
The arguments are: 1) operation (transpose \, ampmod \, ampdev \, freqdev)
2) frame # \, 3) first track \, and 4) value to edit. This does something
different for each operation.;
