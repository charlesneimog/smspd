### Overview

`smspd` is an external library of externals for Miller Puckette's PureData ("pd"). It uses the libsms library for Spectral Modeling and Synthesis Techniques to 
accomplish SMS analysis, synthesis, and modifications in real-time. This code, along with many other SMS related things, was developed in the Music Technology 
Group at UPF. 

See the SMS homepage there: http://mtg.upf.edu/sms. 

The webpage to download both smspd and libsms is: http://mtg.upf.edu/static/libsms/

Currently there are the following externals: `smsbuf`, `smsanal`, `smssynth~`, and `smsedit`. The documentation for these externals is in the form of pd help files.

To see an overview of the set together, see sms-help.pd
